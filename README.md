Tired of getting stuck in the clouds or infinite loading? Me too.. Don't worry tho bc I gotchu gang 

This script will temporarily pause your game upon pressing f9 (or preferred keybind) for 10 seconds and auto resume it. This results in a solo public session and skipping any infinite loading screens. AutoHotKey is required to run this script <3

!! AutoHotKey must be installed. Windows cannot read AHK files without it. !!

You only need the AHK file. The exe file is just there bc why not lol

On line 3, the default keybind is set to F9. Able to change it to whatever u want

If you want the program to auto start on windows launch, here's how to do that.

Step 1. Right click on the file exe or ahk file and create a shortcut. 

Step 2. Win + R

Step 3. type 'shell:startup' in the box.

Step 4. Drag the shortcut into the shell:startup folder.

Step 5. Tadaaaaa enjoy not having to launch resource monitor to bypass loading screens lol
