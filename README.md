Tired of getting stuck in the clouds or infinite loading? Me too.. Don't worry tho bc I gotchu gang 

On line 3, the default keybind is set to F9. Able to change it to whatever u want

The exe will temporarily pause your game for 10 seconds and auto resume it. If you have AutoHotKey installed, use the ahk file.

If you want the program to auto start on windows launch, here's how to do that.

Step 1. Right click on the file exe or ahk file and create a shortcut. 
Step 2. Win + R
Step 3. type 'shell:startup' in the box.
Step 4. Drag the shortcut into the shell:startup folder.
Step 5. Tadaaaaa enjoy not having to launch resource monitor to bypass loading screens lol
