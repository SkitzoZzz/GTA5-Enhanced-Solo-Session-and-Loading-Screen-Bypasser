Tired of getting stuck in the clouds or infinite loading? Me too.. Don't worry tho bc I gotchu gang 

On line 3, the default keybind is set to F9. Able to change it to whatever u want

The script will temporarily pause your game upon pressing f9 (or preferred keybind) for 10 seconds and auto resume it. This results in a solo public session and skipping any infinite loading screens. Also added an ahk file just in case you have AutoHotKey installed <3

If you want the program to auto start on windows launch, here's how to do that.

Step 1. Right click on the file exe or ahk file and create a shortcut. 

Step 2. Win + R

Step 3. type 'shell:startup' in the box.

Step 4. Drag the shortcut into the shell:startup folder.

Step 5. Tadaaaaa enjoy not having to launch resource monitor to bypass loading screens lol
